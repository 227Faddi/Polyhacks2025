- Integrating React with ThreeJS.
- Overcoming deployment challenges in [e.g., Vercel].

**How We Built It:**  
- **Website:** Developed using React and ThreeJS with Vite.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on Vercel, ensuring fast and reliable access.

**Challenges We Faced:**  
- Resolving merge conflicts in `functions.js`.
- Optimizing the build process for production environments.
- Balancing scope and time constraints during the hackathon.
